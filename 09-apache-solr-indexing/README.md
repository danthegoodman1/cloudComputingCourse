#### Why Solr?

Apache Solr is built on top of Apache Lucene, their Java indexing and search engine that is regarded as the industry standard. It's can also be clustered.

*Note: Just like a database, full-text search indexing can be a fundamental part of your operation. Heavily consider having this managed by another company like Algolia if you don't have high volume. It is far less crucial than a database, since you can always fall back on the database for slower searches.*
*See: [https://www.algolia.com](https://www.algolia.com), you can see how expensive search can get at scale, but it is so nice to use.*
