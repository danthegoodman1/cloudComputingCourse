Example:

(show 2 fire hydrants with 2 diff colors)
Are these the same thing?
...yes
Why? They look different? What is the same?
...Shape same
But they are different colors, how could you tell they were the same?
...I've seen them before, they come in different colors

(show 2 birds that look similar but are differnt colors, maybe 2 diff. hawks or 2 diff eagles or somthing)
If I told you this one is X, what is this one? (show 2 birds one they dont know)
... I dont know
But before you just said the 2 objects look the same, but are different colors so you can easily see the similarity? These look the same and are different colors, how are they not the same?

What we can say is that just because something is a similar shape and a different color, or a similar color and a different shape, we can't reason that they are the same. Your brains are the best implementation in the world of pattern recognition. Computers are pretty bad at it, and it takes enormous data sets and compute power to build object detection models that can get anywhere near as accurate as humans.

If I showed you 2 images of an animal you didn't know, combined with your previous knowledge of animals, you could distinguish it from other animals yes? For a computer, I would need hundreds or thousands of well annotated images to start to recognize them.

For example, if I show a ML model 40-50 or so deer images, but that ML model has been trained extensively on farm animals, pictures of deer are still probably going to have 60% or so detection rates of being a sheep. Depending on the model used of course.
