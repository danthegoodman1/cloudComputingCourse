# The Open-Source Cloud Computing Course
Made with ❤️ by Dan The Goodman

## What is this?

Well, I'll introduce myself. My name is Dan Goodman and I am a Co-Founder, Owner, and CDO (Chief Development Officer) of Anchor Security Team. To keep my experience list short, I've worked as a security engineer intern Freshman year of college where I made some very serious contributions and additions to their code base _(NDA...)_. I am the Red Team Champion of the 2018 DoE Cyber Force Competition. I wrote the Delaware SBDC's (Small Business Development Center) cyber material, which won [national awards from NIST](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/FISSEA/Contests-and-Awards/FISSEA-SATE-Winners) _(2019 - Delaware SBDC – Data Assured Program)_, is used by 8+ (at time of writing) other state SBDC's, is being adopted by the USA's SBDC, and is considered best practices by the Deparment of Homeland Security. I am a programming nut, and spend every moment I can spare learning.

So what does that mean? I've learned **a lot** about cloud computing. Through thousands of hours and my experiences with coding production-ready code that can "scale infinitely", pen-testing the hell out of everything I'm allowed to, and years of making my own Linux and virtualization rack-mount servers in my basement, I can pretty much make anything I could think of in the cloud.

This course is designed to go in parallel with my in-class teachings in the VIP program at the University of Delaware, so if I am skipping over topics or steps, it may be because I am showing them in class.

I hope that through this course I can share that knowledge with you, and you can power-up in the amazing world that is cloud computing. Improve your skill set, put "Cloud Computing and Distributed Systems Engineer" on your resume, and flex on all of your developer friends.

Feel free to make a pull request! I'd love to add topics that I haven't yet covered or am not an expert enough in to teach yet.
