# The Open-Source Cloud Computing Course
Made with ❤️ by Dan The Goodman

## What is this?

Well, I'll introduce myself. My name is Dan Goodman and I am a Co-Founder, and Development Lead of Anchor Security Team, and Co-Founder and CTO of Manhattan Space, Inc. To keep my experience list short, I've worked as a security engineer intern Freshman year of college where I made some very serious contributions and additions to their code base _(NDA...)_. I am the Red Team Champion of the 2018 DoE Cyber Force Competition. I wrote the Delaware SBDC's (Small Business Development Center) cyber material, which won [national awards from NIST](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/FISSEA/Contests-and-Awards/FISSEA-SATE-Winners) _(2019 - Delaware SBDC – Data Assured Program)_, is used by 8+ (at time of writing) other state SBDC's, the SBA, and is considered best practices by the Deparment of Homeland Security. I am a programming and cloud computing nut, and spend every moment I can spare learning.

So what does that mean? I've learned **a lot** about cloud computing. Through *(tens of?)* thousands of hours and my experiences with developing production-ready code that can "scale infinitely", pen-testing the hell out of everything I'm allowed to, and years of making my own Linux and virtualization rack-mount servers in my basement.

This course is designed for CPEG 473/673 Cloud Computing and Security, and to go in parallel with the Cloud Computing VIP program at the University of Delaware, so if I am skipping over topics or steps, it may be because I am showing them in class or video.

I hope that through this course I can share my knowledge with you, and you can power-up in the amazing world that is cloud computing. Improve your skill set, put "Cloud Computing and Distributed Systems Engineer" on your resume, and flex on all of your developer friends.

Feel free to make a pull request! I'd love to add topics that I haven't yet covered or am not an expert enough in to teach yet.

## What you will learn

I'm going to try to teach you everything you need to launch a tech startup, work for a giant company, or build a side project. This will include:

- **Databases** like Cassandra/Scylla clusters, Firestore, Datastore, and SQLite
- **Server-client communication** with HTTP/S, Pub/Sub, and secure Websockets to build powerful APIs
- **Distributed Computing** through manually clustering Virtual Machines, Serverless Functions, Docker, Kubernetes, Rancher, Google Cloud Run, Google App Engine, and event triggered workers
- **Supportive technologies** like Full-text search indexing with Apache Solr, Algolia, and custom built solutions, as well as interfacing with third party APIs
- **Security** in Multi-factor Authentication, Secure password handling, OAuth2, RBAC, and Security keys
- **Secure Development Life Cycle** with CI/CD, secure database/resource access, and secure key/token handling
- **Front End** with a sprinkle of HTML, JS, CSS, and React throughout the modules

We'll also do some fun projects:

- **Build a custom VM cluster and autoscaler**
- **Build a serverless websocket chat app**
- **Build a simple Virtual Assistant like Google Home, Siri, and Amazon Echo (Alexa)**
