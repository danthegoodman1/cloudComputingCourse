# The Open-Source Cloud Computing Course
Made with ❤️ by Dan Goodman

## What is this?

Well, I'll introduce myself. My name is Dan Goodman and I am a Co-Founder, Owner, and CDO (Chief Development Officer) of Anchor Security Team. To keep my experience list short, I've worked as a security engineer intern Freshman year of college where I made some very serious contributions and additions to their code base _(NDA...)_. I am the Red Team Champion of the 2018 DoE Cyber Force Competition. I wrote the Delaware SBDC's (Small Business Development Center) cyber material, which won [national awards from NIST](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/FISSEA/Contests-and-Awards/FISSEA-SATE-Winners) _(2019 - Delaware SBDC – Data Assured Program)_, is used by 8+ other state (at time of writing) SBDC's, is being adopted by the USA's SBDC, and is considered best practices by the Deparment of Homeland Security. I am a programming nut, and spend every moment I can spare learning.

So what does that mean? I've learned **a lot** about cloud computing. Through my experiences with coding production-ready code that can "scale infinitely", pen-testing the hell out of everything I'm allowed to, and years of making my own Linux and virtualization rack-mount servers in my basement, I can pretty much make anything I could think of in the cloud.

This course is designed to go in parallel with my in-class teachings in the VIP program at the University of Delaware, so if I am skipping over topics or steps, it may be because I am showing them in class.

I hope that through this course I can share that knowledge with you, and you can power-up in the amazing world that is cloud computing. Improve your skill set, put "Cloud Computing and Distributed Systems Engineer" on your resume, and flex on all of your developer friends.
