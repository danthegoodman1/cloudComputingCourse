# Case Study 2: Software as a Service

## Sometimes SaaS isn't viable

- expensive
- lack of flexibility

## Self-hosted alternatives:

- Elasticsearch for indexing vs something like algolia
- VMs and a custom manager instead of app engine
- Hosted DBs on VMs instead of Firestore/Hosted DBs (something you should spend the most on since it is the most crucial)
